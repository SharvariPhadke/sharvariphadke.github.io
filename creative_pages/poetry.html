                                There she sat, sunflowers all around
                                Under a tree, in the cool of the shade
                                Thinking, emotions flowing
                                Feelings she could not evade;

                                Feelings, she thought,
                                What could love be?
                                Wind, rustling the leaves of the trees,
                                The moon, causing waves in the sea?

                                Love isn't a single emotion
                                It's the feeling of home,
                                The extra spoon of sugar in your tea
                                A feeling; content, happy and warm

                                The petrichor of the rain
                                The crackle of the fire
                                The care, the passion
                                That made love a desire

                                He was home, she thought
                                A constant, her forever;
                                She knew it was he,
                                Whose existence made her better

                                Twas a miracle, she thought
                                For in a cosmos infinite
                                She was drawn to him,
                                Like a moth, to a flame well lit.

                                From the moment they met
                                She knew he was the one
                                Her rock, her strength
                                Her heart, he'd won.

                                Dreamy gaze, teary eyes
                                Waking up, I realise
                                No dream was he
                                For I was her, she was me.

                                What if home was not a place, but just a moment in time?
                                What if home was that instant
                                Where everything was tranquil, calm, serene,
                                An escape, from the typical arid routine.

                                What if home was that moment
                                That cold evening, that steaming hot chocolate
                                Curled up fireside, nose deep in a book
                                Snow settling on a quiet night, look!

                                What if home was that moment
                                That moment where, in life, you found
                                Your passion, your one true purpose,
                                The bourne of your being, no longer ambiguous?

                                What if home was that moment
                                With your soulmate, frozen in time
                                Reminiscing for what feels like an aeon,
                                Blissful, content, unwilling to move on?

                                What if home wasn't just home
                                But an avalanche of such musings
                                If you were a leaf swaying in their breeze,
                                Would you savor it, would you be at peace?

                                It's raining, gently pattering away
                                The race of the raindrops
                                Down the window, all foggy
                                Twisting and turning, rushing down the glass,
                                Glass, to the touch, cold and gloomy.

                                Look a bit beyond; at the dew covered flower
                                Feel its viridity, savour its beauty,
                                The quiet pitter patter, just like music
                                The rain, gently drumming on the leaf, like
                                A gentle kiss on the hand, so to speak.

                                Imagine a meadow, overgrown plants, waist-high
                                Facing the sky, arms spread, palms drenched
                                The cool breeze wafting through the puff sleeve
                                The hem of the shirt, fluttering like a butterfly
                                The setting sun, as noon turns to eve.

                                Imagine a château, somewhere south of France
                                Reading Shakespeare, engrossed, in a trance,
                                On a plush couch, the tea, piping hot
                                Steam windborne, like the dance of two fairies
                                It's not just rain, it's nature's art.

                                Imagine a lone beach, thunder rumbling,
                                The wave crashing, bearing vengeance on the rock
                                A bolt of lightning straight into the sea,
                                A sudden surge of thrill down the spine, eyes wide,
                                An overwhelming love for all that is earthly.

                                Can any poem, any poet, ever do justice
                                To the thrill of the thunder, the rage of the rain
                                The calm before the storm, the peace after
                                Will words simply ever be enough, to rightfully
                                Romanticise the many moods of the weather?
